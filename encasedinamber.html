		OCD is a tricky thing to talk about, because it's almost kind of mysterious in ways. It's difficult to pin down what it really even is. For me, as someone with OCD, this problem doesn't really go away. Sure, I may understand more about the ways in which OCD works, how it "tricks" you and such, but through it all I'm still left with the overwhelming feeling that something is "wrong". This feeling, despite the therapy (both in and out of an office) I've done, doesn't really fully go away. Not even when I took medication did it fully go away. It's a feeling that haunts you even, perhaps especially, in your sleep. Over time, it starts to close you off, make you wary of everything, make you skeptical of life itself, and turn inwards to the self for every problem. Over time, though, you realize that you don't have the answers to the anxieties you feel. Sometimes that means that you'll let it go, but usually it means that you find yourself digging deeper.
		<br>
		<br>
		Imagine that you've just discovered that the world is going to end in two weeks. You've confirmed it eight times over, ruminated about it for hours, tried to disprove it by reading what other people say about it on the internet, but in the end you are convinced that the world is going to end. What do you do? How do you move on with your day? Imagine you tell this to your family - they laugh with a hint of concern in their voice and tell you to sit down for dinner. You eat as if nothing is even happening, but deep down you know - you know it's all for nothing.
		<br>
		<br>
		OCD doesn't care about your time. It will rob you of hours of your life, poke you with the cattle prod until it wrings every last thought out of your brain, only to leave you drained of life at two in the morning. You try to make up the time you've lost, but it's too late. The party has ended, the band is going home, and the park is closed. I won't claim that OCD had caused every hardship in my life, that would be ridiculous. A more accurate way to look at it might be to imagine OCD as a body guard. 
		<br>
		<br>
		Let's say you move into a new town and want to make some friends, and you go to a local gathering to meet people. Before you can enter, though, a large man with cold soulless eyes looks at you. 
		<br>
		<br>
		"There's poison on your hands", he says. 
		<br>
		"No there's not", you reply.
		<br>
		"But don't you remember? That green gunk you touched on the door handle. How could you forget?"
		<br>
		"That was probably just matcha or something."
		<br>
		"Sure... Why would matcha be on the door handle of an Italian restraunt? It was probably the mob trying to kill someone."
		<br>
		"You're ridiculous."
		<br>
		"Am I? It looks like you're not so sure yourself. You have been feeling a little odd recently, haven't you? Your chest hurts, you heart is beating, your muscles hurt..."
		<br>
		"I don't know, it's just nerves I guess."
		<br>
		"Better to check. You know, WebMD says the symptoms of poisoning are high heart rate, pain in the chest, and muscle soreness? Didn't you say you were feeling that?"
		<br>
		"Huh, maybe I better lay down for a while...""
		<br>
		<br>
		And so you lie down for an hour or two, and say goodbye to any chance to meet new people. No matter, you think, you'll just wait till the next event. But again and again the man comes. And again and again you wait. Eventually you start to lose sight of people, and feel lost. Sure, you have friends, but they don't really get to know you, because you don't even know yourself. It's been years it seems since you've allowed yourself to be someone, to be the person you once were. It's almost like the person you once were has been locked away in a cell, forced to do the bidding of someone else. Or like a memory, encased in amber.
		<br>
		<br>
		Recently, I think I've been chipping away at that amber...
